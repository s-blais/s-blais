**Greetings Gitters,**

I'm a freshly-minted full-stack developer (courtesy of [Flatiron School](https://flatironschool.com/)), eager to use all the fun new tools in my toolbelt.

I am excited to put my new knowledge to work with a small- to medium-sized team as a junior developer, product/project manager, or techy factotum. Design-emphasized environments particularly resonate with me, as I have worked among designers of many kinds for years. 

Some skills I'd prefer to not keep to myself:
