## Greetings Gitters,

I'm a freshly-minted full-stack developer (courtesy of [Flatiron School](https://flatironschool.com/)), eager to use and expand the fun new tools in my toolbelt.

I am excited to put my new knowledge to work with a small- to medium-sized team as a junior developer, product/project manager, or techy factotum. Design-emphasized environments particularly resonate with me, as I have worked among designers of many kinds for years. 

Since January 2022, I've been doing lots of work in a MySQL/[Retool](https://retool.com/) environment, developing internal apps for an investment fund. Cool stuff; have been learning a lot!
 
### Some things I can do:
